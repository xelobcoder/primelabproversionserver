## Summary
The `publishEmail` method is responsible for publishing an email by updating the target and ispublished fields in the database table, and then sending the email to the specified recipients. If the email is a bulk email and the server has more than 2 CPU cores, the email is sent immediately. Otherwise, the email is scheduled to be sent at a later time when the server is less busy.

## Example Usage
```javascript
const emailService = new EmailService();
const records = {
  id: 1,
  target: ['john@example.com', 'jane@example.com'],
  category: 'clients',
  schedule: '2022-01-01 00:00:00'
};
const result = await emailService.publishEmail(records);
console.log(result); // true
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `records` (object): An object containing the following properties:
  - `id` (number): The ID of the email to be published.
  - `target` (array): An array of email addresses to send the email to.
  - `category` (string): The category of the email (e.g., 'clients', 'bulk clients').

___
### Flow
1. Check if the email service is activated. If not, return the message "Email service is not activated".
2. Determine if the email is a bulk email by checking if the category is 'bulk clients' or 'bulk staff'.
3. Check if the format of the target is valid by verifying that it is an array.
4. If the email is not a bulk email and the format of the target is valid, convert the target array into a JSON string.
5. If the email is a bulk email, set the refinedTarget to the category value.
6. Update the target and ispublished fields in the database table with the refinedTarget and schedule values.
7. If the update is successful, check if the server has more than 2 CPU cores and if the refinedTarget is "all staffs" or "all clients".
8. If the conditions are met, schedule the email to be sent at a later time using the shedular method.
9. If the conditions are not met, retrieve the published email draft from the database.
10. Send the email to the first recipient in the target array using the sendComposedEmail method.
11. Return the status of the email sending process.
